                    The RIT Alumni Foundation is an entity created by alumni of Lambda Phi Epsilon, Beta Epsilon chapter
                    of RIT. First and foremost, it was created for alumni and is run by alumni. We formed a partnership
                    with the Lambda Phi Epsilon Foundation so that tax-exempt charitable donations can be made to an
                    endowment fund set up for us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to keep the RIT Alumni Foundation running, we pay an annual $500 maintenance fee, so we
                    must make the best use of it.

                    We intend to award an <b>annual $500 scholarship to the "RIT Lambda of the Year".</b>
                    The scholarship amount is subject to change in the future. Funds can also be used for social events,
                    such as brotherhood retreats and anniversaries.

                <p>
                    This is one of the best ways to pay less in taxes AND save up funds for the future. This money will
                    eventually go back to you and our chapter. With a company match, your donation is automatically
                    doubled. Wouldn't you like to secure your spot at an event with a premium venue? 🙂

                    bookkeeping, emails, Slack notifications, storing information in a database, and sending tax
                    receipts.

                    A tax deduction is an amount that you can deduct from your taxable income to lower the amount of
                    taxes that you owe. This applies to all donations to the RIT Alumni Foundation.

                    For example, for GoDaddy, I can make charitable donations through a third-party portal. Another way
                    I can do it is to first make a donation through PayPal and wait until I get the tax receipt from the
                    Lambda Phi Epsilon Foundation. Once I have the tax receipt, I can send a request to GoDaddy stating
                    that I made a donation to a 501(c)(3) organization and attach the tax receipt. GoDaddy will match up
                    to $1500 every fiscal year, but that does not mean I will donate $1500.
